# 📧 Spam Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model to classify emails or messages as spam or not spam**. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and analysis — all organized for scalability and reproducibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-classification.git
cd spam-classification
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download / Prepare dataset:**
Place your dataset inside the `data/` directory. Example datasets:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

## ⚙️ How to Run

To execute the entire pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or run individual components using the `src/` modules (for development and testing).

## 📊 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw text data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, etc.).
- **Model Training**: Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
- **Evaluation**: Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Explore data and experiment with different models interactively.

## 📈 Example Results

| Metric        | Value  |
|---------------|--------|
| Accuracy      | 98.5%  |
| Precision     | 97.8%  |
| Recall        | 98.9%  |
| F1-Score      | 98.3%  |

*(Example placeholder — actual results depend on dataset and model)*

## ✅ TODO

- [ ] Add more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).
- [ ] Improve model performance and tuning.
- [ ] Add interactive web app for live predictions.
- [ ] Extend dataset for better generalization.
